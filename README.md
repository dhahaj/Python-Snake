Based on the assumptions and requirements, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Snake` class (in `model.py`): This will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods for moving the snake, growing the snake, and checking for collisions.

2. `Food` class (in `model.py`): This will represent the food in the game. It will have methods for placing the food at a random location on the screen.

3. `Game` class (in `model.py`): This will represent the game itself. It will have methods for starting the game, ending the game, and updating the game state.

4. `GameView` class (in `view.py`): This will be responsible for displaying the game on the screen. It will have methods for drawing the snake, the food, and the game over message.

5. `GameController` class (in `controller.py`): This will handle user input. It will have methods for processing key presses.

6. `main` function (in `main.py`): This will be the entry point of the program. It will create instances of the `Game`, `GameView`, and `GameController` classes and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
